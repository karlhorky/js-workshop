          If we want to continue on our trends of growth, and the overwhelmingly
          positive outcomes for societies that come with it, every individual
          must become more concerned with the welfare of those around us—and in
          the world at large and most of all our descendants in the future. So,
          how do we proceed? Cowen, in a culmination of 20 years of thinking and
          research, provides a roadmap for moving forward.
          <em
            >Stubborn Attachments: A Vision for a Society of Free, Prosperous,
            and Responsible Individuals</em
          >
          argues that our reason and common sense can help free us of the faulty
          ideas that hold us back as people and as a society. Cowen’s latest
          book, at its heart, makes the contemporary moral case for economic
          growth and in doing so engenders a great dose of inspiration and
          optimism about our future possibilities.
